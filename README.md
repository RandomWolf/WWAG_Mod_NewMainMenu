# New Main Menu for Wizard with a Gun
This is the first modification to the game Wizard With a Gun (Demo)

It replaces the standard sitting-on-a-log start menu with an animation I found in the files.

## Installation
# Installing BepInEx
1. Download the BepInEx ZIP File from the official BepInEx repository. I have used version 5.4.21 found [here](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.21)
2. Extract the BepInEx ZIP File into the games "root" folder
  2.1. Download the ZIP File from the link above, then extract its contents into the main folder of your WWAG Steam Installation. This is most commonly under:
   `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Wizard with a Gun Demo`
3. Run the game with BepInEx Installed atleast once. This will generate needed Config files and folders in your WWAG Game directory
4. Close the game

# Installing the mod
1. Download the latest release of the mod found [here](https://github.com/RandomWolf/WWAG_Mod_NewMainMenu/releases/tag/Release)
2. Extract the Contents of the ZIP file into `Wizard with a Gun Demo\BepInEx\plugins\WWAG_NewIntro.dll`

The mod should now be installed.
